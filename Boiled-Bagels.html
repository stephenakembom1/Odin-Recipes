            <h2>Boiled Bagels</h2>
            <p>For a glossier surface, place raised bagels on an ungreased baking sheet prior to<br> boiling them. Broil them, 5 inches from heat, for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes on each side.<br> Then put them into the hot water to be boiled as above. Note: do not bake<br> broiled bagels as long as non-broiled ones, 25 minutes should be long enough.</p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>4 ¼ cups all-purpose flour, divided, or as needed</li>
                <li>2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast</li>
                <li>1 ½ cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
                <li>4 tablespoons white sugar, divided</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol> 
                <li>Combine 1 1/2 cups flour and yeast in a large bowl. Mix water, 3 tablespoons<br> sugar, and salt together; add to dry ingredients. Beat with a mixer for half a<br> minute at low speed, scraping the sides of the bowl clean. Beat at a higher<br> speed for 3 minutes. Then mix in enough flour by hand to make a moderately<br> stiff dough.</li>
                <li>Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic,<br> 8 to 10 minutes. Cover and let rest for 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Cut into 12 portions and shape into smooth balls. Poke a hole in the center with<br> your finger, and gently enlarge the hole while working the bagel into a uniform<br> shape. Cover and let rise for 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, start a gallon of water boiling. Add in remaining 1 tablespoon sugar<br> and mix it around a bit. Reduce to simmering.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
                <li>When bagels have risen, put 4 or 5 bagels into the water and cook for 7 minutes,<br> turning once. Drain.</li>
                <li>Place drained bagels on a greased baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven<br> for 30 to 35 minutes. Remove from the oven and eat hot or cold.</li>
            </ol>
